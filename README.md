## __Our Process__ ⍟🦸‍♂️

* Started off using Excalidraw to create a wireframe.
![wireframe](./assets/img/wireframe.png)

* Once the wireframing was done, we split up the work that needed to be done.

* An index.html and a character.html were created.

* We decided to use Foundation as our framework and started styling our pages.

* Once the html and styling were almost completed the javascript was started.

* Script files were created for the index page and as well as the character page. A third one was created as well which is titled md5.js and the reason for this file is to create a hash which is being used by the Marvel API.

* Once all the files were created, it was just a manner of finalizing/tweaking the code to get the desired effect for our webpage.

### __What We learned__ 🔫👱‍♂️🎧🎶
​
Since we started working on this project, we have learned a lot. We learned how to use a new framework, (blahblahblah)
​
​
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
​
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
 color: papayawhip;
}
```
​
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
 console.log("🎉");
};
```

### __Continued Development__ ⚫️👩🏻‍🦰
​
After finishing our project, we've begun to understand things more clearly now and how exactly frameworks work. We got a better understanding of CSS and Javascript and so for our future projects we are just hoping to implement our knowledge into those projects to make them better than what we have right now.

### __Useful Resources__ 🙅🏿🐈‍⬛👨🏿‍🦱
​
- [Markdown Guide](https://github.com/darsaveli/Readme-Markdown-Syntax) - This really helps with the understanding of Markdown syntax for ReadMes and it allowed us to create a nicely structured ReadMe.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
