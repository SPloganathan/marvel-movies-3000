## __Our Process__ ⍟🦸‍♂️

* Started off using Excalidraw to create a wireframe
![wireframe](./assets/img/wireframe.png)

* Once the wireframing was done, we split up the work that needed to be done

* An index.html and a character.html were created

* We decided to use Foundation as our framework and started styling our pages

* Once the html and styling were almost completed the javascript was started

* Script files were created for the index page and as well as the character page. A third one was created as well which is titled md5.js and the reason for this file was the API site we were using required that code to be used

* Once all the files were created, it was just a manner of finalizing/tweaking the code to get the desired effect for our webpage
